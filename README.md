Project Overview:
The project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. It includes a responsive layout with sections for about me, portfolio, skills, certifications, and contact details.

Design and Development Process:

Planning: I began with sketching wireframes to outline the siteâ€™s layout and flow. I used tools like Figma for design mockups.

Implementation: The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I chose these technologies for their flexibility and compatibility with modern web standards. CSS was used for styling, including animations and responsive design, while JavaScript handles form validation and interactivity.

Challenges and Solutions: One challenge was implementing a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. I resolved this by using media queries and a flexible grid layout to ensure the site adapts to various screen sizes.

Testing and Refinement: I tested the website across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent appearance and functionality. Feedback from peers was also incorporated to enhance the user experience.
